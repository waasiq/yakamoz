### Source code:

I will add documentation about how the source code is working and comments on how things
are working behind the scenes. You can always contact me on mail through my Github profile and
I would love to show the working on source code.

### Local file reading

1. You can edit the app.ykmz file or add a new file to read from it start the shell script.
Use the following command to read from the file:

```
    yakamoz>>> run('app.ykmz')
```

2. Language on local shell similar to python also works.

```
    yakamoz >> oyleki a = 10
    yakamoz >> yazdir(a)
```
